JavaScript Concepts Used:
- Event handling: Event listeners are added to the panel headers to respond to user clicks.
- DOM manipulation: The querySelector and classList methods are used to select and modify elements in the DOM.
- CSS manipulation: JavaScript adds or removes CSS classes to trigger flexbox transitions and animations.
- Conditional statements: Conditional statements are used to check the current state of a panel and determine the appropriate action to take (expand or collapse).
